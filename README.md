# PianoECom 🎹🎸
A full-stack e-commerce marketplace for music lovers to **buy, rent, or sell** instruments and gear.

> Portfolio project focused on **backend + full-stack** fundamentals (clean architecture, REST APIs, security, database modeling, testing, and production-minded practices).

## Why this project
Music communities often rely on scattered groups and informal listings. **PianoECom** centralizes discovery and transactions so people can:
- list instruments and accessories,
- rent gear for short-term needs (events, practice, studio),
- buy used/new equipment from trusted sellers.
